This is my boss, Jonathan Hart, a self-made millionaire, he's quite a guy. This is Mrs H., she's
gorgeous, she's one lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care
of both of them, which ain't easy, 'cause when they met it was MURDER!

Top Cat! The most effectual Top Cat! Who's intellectual close friends get to call him T.C., providing
it's with dignity. Top Cat! The indisputable leader of the gang. He's the boss, he's a pip, he's the
championship. He's the most tip top, Top Cat.

Just the good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm. Beats all you've ever saw, been in trouble with the law
since the day they was born. Straight'nin' the curve, flat'nin' the hills. Someday the mountain might
get 'em, but the law never will. Makin' their way, the only way they know how, that's just a little bit
more than the law will allow. Just good ol' boys, wouldn't change if they could, fightin' the system
like a true modern day Robin Hood.
