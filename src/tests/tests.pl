%% Test: write several lines in each process, check that lines are not
%% interleaved. In this test is proved that a process is blocked by 
%% the semaphore until the running process execute the sem_post.
%% The critical section is the file in which the process are writing,
%% The access of that file must be (and is) synchronized by the semaphore.

%% Test: A number in a file, Number process incrementing that number

%% Test: Start Number process and each process increments Iter times a

%% Like in the last test the critical section is the file, but instead
%% of to have 2 processes doing X iterations, in this test we have
%% Number processes doing Iter iterations so, the probability to have
%% a race condition is very high Sempahore with value 1 must
